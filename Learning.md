- pushing to a repo
  - git push --set-upstream `origin master`
- Editing directly on github
  - clicking on a file and editing it however then commiting the changes.
- fetch
  - a command that fetches a change from a remote repo but does not merge with the local repo
- merge
  - you know what merge does
- pull
  - git pull `origin`
  - this fetches and merges the latest version of the project from github.
